Following the resolution of [WEBUI-237](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/WEBUI-237):
- The `threejs` dependency was updated from `v0.81.0` to `v0.125.0`.
- The `loaders` directory was added with the (`v0.81.0`) loader utilities necessary to maintain the load of GLTF v1.0 models. These are now imported via ESM.
- The `controls` directory was added with the (`v0.81.0`) control utilities so that they can now be imported via ESM.
